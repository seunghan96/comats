## S-Mamba

## Contributions :trophy:

- We propose S-Mamba, a Mamba-based model for time series forecasting, which delegates the extraction of inter-variate correlations and temporal dependencies to a bidirectional Mamba block and a Feed-Forward network. 
- We evaluate the performance of S-Mamba, which not only has low GPU memory required and short time for forecasts but also maintains superior performance compared to the representative and state-of-the-art models. 
- We conduct extensive experiments to further delve deeper into Mamba's potential in time series forecasting tasks.
